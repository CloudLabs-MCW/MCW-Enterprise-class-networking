## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will setup and configure virtual networks in a secure hub-and-spoke design. You will also learn how to secure virtual networks by implementing Azure Firewall, network security groups and application security groups, as well as configure route tables on the subnets in your virtual network. Additionally, you will set up access to the virtual network via a jump box and provision a site-to-site VPN connection from another virtual network, providing emulation of hybrid connectivity from an on-premises environment.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to configure Azure networking components.
